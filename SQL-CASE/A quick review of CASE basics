// A quick review of CASE basics:
// 1. The CASE statement always goes in the SELECT clause
// 2. CASE must include the following components: WHEN, THEN, and END. ELSE is an optional component.
// 3. You can make any conditional statement using any conditional operator (like WHERE ) between WHEN and THEN. This includes stringing together multiple conditional statements using AND and OR.
// 4. You can include multiple WHEN statements, as well as an ELSE statement to deal with any unaddressed conditions.
